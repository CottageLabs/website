Cottage Labs blabla has worked with institutional libraries, museums and knowledge organisations for over 10 years, building repositories to house their intellectual property like student thesis, publications, grey literature, and small to medium size research data (upto a few 100 GB in size).

We build bespoke repositories and  repositories based on open source platforms namely [Hyrax](https://hyrax.samvera.org/) offered by the [Samvera](https://samvera.org/) community, [DSpace](https://dspace.lyrasis.org/) and [InvenioRDM](https://invenio-software.org/products/rdm/).

When working with open source platforms, we tailor the platforms to support one or more custom metadata profiles, personalised workflows, and integration with other services for providing a rich experience for your users.

We have built bespoke repositories to support special research projects to collect, process, analyze and showcase their data and lifeâ€™s work.
