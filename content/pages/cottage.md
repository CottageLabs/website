# 3D Cottage Lab

Now you too can build your own Cottage Lab!

If you are on this page you have most likely got your hands on our exclusive 3D Cottage Labs paper craft model. This was designed and built entirely by our team of engineers at Cottage Labs, who can turn their hands to any challenge.

Here you will find your step-by-step assembly guide.

Before we start, some general tips:

* Pre-fold along the creases before assembling any parts, this will make it easier to work with
* When inserting the tabs, they are designed so that you can insert one end first, slide it all the way in and accross, and then insert the other end

## The Cottage

1. Pre-fold the door segment at the right end of the part.  Either side of the door fold back and then forwards, so the door will stand out from the wall when the part is asembled.

2. Fold the cottage around into a 4 sided structure.  The 2 right panels of the cottage will wrap around the outside, so the door sits over the front wall.

3. Tuck the tab on the right of the door into the vertical slot on the corner of the cottage.

4. Above the door, fold the side flaps in, and the front flap down.  Push the front flap's tab into the horizontal slot in the front wall of the cottage.  Once done, you can reach inside the cottage and fold the flap to provide more strength.

5. Fold the roof flaps back along their creases.

## The Roof

1. Fold the roof in half along the centre crease.

2. Fold both end sections inward, and press the structure flat to create sharp folds.

3. Find the slots near the apex of the roof, these are where the chimney will go.  Position the roof over the house such that these chimney slots are at the rear of the house.

4. Insert one of the tabs sticking up from the cottage into one of the large slots on the underside of the roof.

5. Fold the roof over the peak of the cottage and insert the tab on the other side.

## The Chimney

1. Fold the chimney part around into a four sided shape, and insert the tab.  One of the panels will wrap around the outside so that the tab at the end can be inserted into the vertical slot on the corner.

2. Place the chimney over the roof, with the tabs lined up with the roof slots, and push the chimney into position.

3. Fold the shorter end sides up, and then over the tabs, and press the flaps into place.

4. Fold the long sides over and press their flaps into place too.

5. Turn the garden so the print side faces up.
