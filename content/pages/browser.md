#OUR PROJECTS

We’re a small company working on diverse projects including data repositories, data visualisation, and infrastructure to support Open Access publishing. Projects can run from a few months to years and usually involve development, customisation, and the deployment of data management and analysis platforms. To give you greater insight into the kind of work we do here at Cottage Labs, below you’ll find a selection of highlights from our work over the years.
