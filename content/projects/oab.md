This quickly grew into a suite of tools to help authors self-archive, to help other infrastructure services to unerstand about self-archiving policies, and to provide next generation inter-library loans tools.

Cottage Labs has been working with OA.Works since 2013 back when it was called OA Button.  The platform, at its heart, monitors the Self-Archiving policies of journals, and it now provides multiple tools to support Open Access, such as rapid self-archiving, and intra-library loans.
