challenge:
    text: Since beginning to work with DOAJ in 2013 the platform's requirements have expanded considerably.  The volume of content has grown many times over, the number of active users is extremely high, and it has complex data management and review requirements.  Our challenge has been to scale the platform in all these directions while maintaining service continuity, and adapting to the changing needs of the Open Access landscape.

solution:
    text: We have developed a layered and modular application for DOAJ, which allows us to provide appropriate functionality for all user classes.  This includes a web interface for end-users and a variety of API and data download features for external integrators.  For administrators and editors we have provided powerful workflow and data management tools, with a variety of automations to streamline processes.  The architecture of this system allows us to easily scale, and maintain 99.999% uptime under continuous and intense load.
