challenge:
  text: EMLO digital systems were first designed and developed in 2009 by the Bodleian Libraries Oxford. They have since then been in c0nstant use with the union catalogue growing in collection. In 2022, Cottage Labs were tasked with upating all of the EMLO digital systems, with the aim of modernising the software infrastructure, with monor changes to its functionality. Importantly, we had to  retain the database structure and the design interoperability, as EMLO had a few sub-systems, and they had to continue to work together, while we were upgarding each sub-system at a time.

solution:
  text: The database structure of EMLO edit showcased the organic growth of EMLO. We identifed bottlenecks and improved the perfromance of the underlying  database design, while retaining interoperability with other old sub-systems. We modernised the design of EMLO edit taking along the editorial team and theirt ways of working.

success:
  text: Cootage Labs have been in partnership with the EMLO team, working closely on delivering a robust technical platform to satisfy their usage and is easily maintainable. We have now developed and deployed the upgraded EMLO Edit interface and our currently working on upgrading the EMLO public discovery interface. Following this, we will be working on adding more functionality to EMLO Edit, expanding its functionality to allow community edits. We aim to complte the upgrade of all of the EMLo sub-sysytems by the end of 2024-2025 project period.

**Early Modern Letters Online**, a creation by the Cultures of Knowledge Project, is a collaborative, interdisciplinary research project based at the University of Oxford. 

Bringing together experts in history, philosophy, science, and literature with librarians, archivists, and systems developers, Cultures of Knowledge is using digital methods to reassemble and interpret the correspondence networks of the early modern period. 

Early Modern Letters Online is a growing union catalogue of correspondence from the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. EMLO is a combined finding aid and editorial interface, building basic descriptions of early modern correspondence.
